**WubHub** is a sophisticated organizational tool designed specifically for musicians to collaborate, manage projects, and streamline their creative workflow. This platform demonstrates modern full-stack development practices with a focus on handling large file uploads, real-time collaboration, and scalable architecture.

## 🎯 Project Overview

WubHub addresses the unique challenges musicians face when collaborating on projects - from managing large audio files to organizing complex project structures. The platform provides a comprehensive solution for music creators to store, organize, and collaborate on their work with team members.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎛️ **Workspace Management System**
- Multi-workspace architecture supporting different projects, bands, or collaborations
- Hierarchical container system for organizing files (similar to folders but optimized for music projects)
- Role-based access control with granular permissions

### 📁 **Advanced File Management**
- **Chunked Upload System**: Custom-built solution for handling large audio files (up to 5GB)
- **Queue Management**: Batch processing system with progress tracking and error handling
- **Smart File Organization**: Drag & drop interface with automatic file type detection
- **Multiple Format Support**: Audio files (WAV, MP3, FLAC), project files (Logic Pro, Ableton), documents, and archives

### 🚀 **Robust Upload Architecture**
- **Resumable Uploads**: Fault-tolerant chunked upload system with automatic retry logic
- **Pre-flight Validation**: File validation and user permission checks before upload
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with detailed analytics
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) for scalable file storage

### 👥 **Collaboration Features**
- **User Role System**: Owner/collaborator permissions with workspace-level access control
- **Track Content Management**: Rich metadata support with descriptions, tags, and notes
- **Secure Sharing**: Controlled access to projects and individual files

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Backend - Rails API
```ruby
# Core Technologies
- Ruby on Rails 7.0+ (API-only mode)
- PostgreSQL 15+ with advanced indexing
- Redis 7+ for caching and session management
- Cloudflare R2 for cloud storage
- JWT authentication with bcrypt encryption
```

**Key Components:**
- **Upload Service Layer**: Custom services handling chunked uploads, validation, and queue management
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Polymorphic role system supporting multiple entity types
- **File Processing Pipeline**: Background job processing for large file operations
- **RESTful API Design**: Comprehensive API with proper HTTP status codes and error handling

### Frontend - Next.js Application
```typescript
# Core Technologies
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- React hooks for state management
- Custom upload components with progress tracking
```

**Key Features:**
- **Dark Mode Interface**: Modern UI optimized for music production workflows
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress tracking and live upload status
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable UI components with TypeScript support

### Infrastructure & DevOps
```yaml
# Development & Deployment
- Docker & Docker Compose for local development
- Comprehensive testing suite (RSpec + Jest)
- CI/CD ready configuration
- Environment-based configuration management
```

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Custom Upload System
Built a sophisticated chunked upload system that handles:
- **Fault Tolerance**: Automatic retry logic and error recovery
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with detailed metrics
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage for large file processing
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Multiple file upload processing with queue management

### Database Design
```sql
-- Optimized schema design with proper indexing
- Polymorphic associations for flexible role system
- JSONB fields for metadata storage
- Composite indexes for performance optimization
- Foreign key constraints ensuring data integrity
```

### API Architecture
- **RESTful Design**: Following REST conventions with proper HTTP methods
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with detailed messages
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- **Validation**: Multi-layer validation (client-side, API, and database level)

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- **Chunked Processing**: Large files processed in manageable chunks to prevent memory issues
- **Background Jobs**: Time-intensive operations moved to background processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing and query optimization for large datasets

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 95%+ test coverage across models, controllers, and services
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow testing for complex upload scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing for concurrent upload scenarios
- **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization testing
